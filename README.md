## <b>What is Hacktober Fest?</b>

Hacktoberfest is a month-long open source contribution program hosted by DigitalOcean in the month of October for supporting open source development. Hacktoberfest encourages participation in the open source community, which grows bigger every year. Whether you are a pro in programming or a newbie, Hacktoberfest welcomes each one of the contributors for providing their valuable contribution to the open source community. Completing the challenge earns you a limited edition swags and other exiciting goodies.
